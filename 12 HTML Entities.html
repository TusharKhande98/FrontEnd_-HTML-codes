    <pre>       we used pre tag for showing space            in paragraphs, but now we used non-breaking space line special symbol with help of HTML entities...</pre>

    <p>Here we se some single-space &nbsp; by using entities in paragraph without changing a text format as pre tag</p>
    <p>Here we se some 2x-space &nbsp; &nbsp; by using entities in paragraph without changing a text format as pre tag</p>
    <p>Here we se some 4x-space &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by using entities in paragraph without changing a text format as pre tag</p>
